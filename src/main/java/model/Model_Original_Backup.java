// This is a backup of the original Model.java file before refactoring
// The original file has been split into multiple service classes:
// - DatabaseManager.java
// - UserService.java  
// - RecipeService.java
// - ValidationService.java
// - ImageService.java
// - UIUtils.java
// 
// The new Model.java serves as a facade that coordinates between these services
// while maintaining the same public interface for backward compatibility.
//
// Original file content was moved to preserve functionality.
